# Here are potential answers to the example questions in the final SQL project. 
# Note that there are often multiple ways to write SQL to come up with the same answer.

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#8 How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID
SELECT t.name, inv.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks t

LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t ON t.TrackId = inv.TrackId
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a ON a.AlbumId = t.Albumid

ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total),2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

#14 Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009
SELECT emp.FirstName,emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) AS [Total Sales]
